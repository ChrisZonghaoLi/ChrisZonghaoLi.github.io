	  <p>Creating and hosting my own small website is on my to-do list for really a while, which I did not manage to get it started until the 
	  end of 2017, due to my terrible time management (I guess...) and my life-long unforgetable Christmas holiday (I need to find something 
	  to do to distract my mind from breaking down with my grilfriend after the 5-year long-distance relationship). Surely, there are countless tutorials 
	  about building-up your own website from scratch, some of them can be a bit of time-consuming, some of them are just purely over-simplified, or some of them just
	  do not work... I knew using Github Pages to host personal website and I did found it was extremely efficient, simple, and straightforward. 
	  I will say if you are NOT a serious website designer/architect, and if are someone like me who just would like to have a personal website
	  for fun without investing too much time and money on it, this guide might be helpful to you. There are also many other Github Pages
	  tutorials available on Google, I write this guide is also for my own track, so I will appriciate if you have any suggestions
	  and feedbacks, and please you are welcome to contact me (see <b>About</b> in the navigation bar for the methods to be in touch with me).</p>
	  
	  <li>As this guide is based on Github Pages, you should first have a Github account. Skip this step if you have one.</li>
	  
	  <li>If you have your Github account, you can then refer to the offical guide of the Github Pages on how to 
	  construct your first <font face="courier">Hello World</font> website (click <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"></b>here</b></a> for the brief tutorial).</li>
	  
	  <li>It is possible (you might spend money for your site on elsewhere which I am not sure...) for you to have a totally free personal website 
	  if you do NOT want to have a custom domain; your default site domian should be <font face="courier"><i>username</i>.github.io</font>. If you do 
	  not like it and would like to have your own custom domain, it means you need to buy your own custom domain. You can skip the next step if you do NOT want to do so.</li>
	  
	  <li>Skip this step if you do NOT want to buy your own custom domain. There are many places to buy domains, 
	  the one I bought was from <a href="https://ca.godaddy.com/" target="_blank"></b>GoDaddy</b></a>. Again, you need to have an account before any shopping... Once you do 
	  so, you can search your desired domain name to see if it is still available. I will generally suggest to use your name as your domain name for your own site, just easier
	  for people to memorize. The following picture is just an example of using <font face="courier">helloworld1234</font> for the domain name registration search. Usually
	  uncommon custom domains are very cheap, in this case 7 RMB is about 1.1 USD for one year registration cost. So, why not?</li>

	  </div>
	  <br><br>
	  
	  <li>Once you have your custom domain registered, you need to do some configurations in order to activate it. These settings will be done in two places to make your 
	  custom domain function on your website, starting with the configrautions on GoDaddy: go to your personal account and find out "DNS Management" of the custom domian
	  you just purchased, then you need to add three "Records", which are highlighted in red color (the rest records are generated by the system and should not be touched).
	  The first two IP addresses, namely <font face="courier">192.30.252.153</font> and <font face="courier">192.30.252.154</font>, are Github Pages addresses, your site IP
	  address should be one of them, which can be check by using <font face="courier">dig</font> command in your <font face="courier">Linux</font> OS. You can just simply 
	  add both of these to the records (record type is <font face="courier">A</font>) to avoid confusions. Then you also need to add type <font face="courier">CNAME</font>
	  record whose value is the default domain name of your Github Pages, namely  <font face="courier"><i>username</i>.github.io</font>. By doing so it tells to point this custom
	  domain to your Github Pages website. These settings are summarized in <i>Fig. 2.</i></li>
	  
	  <br><br>
	  <div class="w3-container w3-center">

		<caption align="bottom">Fig. 2 GoDaddy DNS Management</caption>
	  </div>
	  <br><br>
	  
	  <li>Next, you should do the same <font face="courier">CNAME</font> record settings on your Github Pages repository. Go to its setting and find out the place to
	  input your custom domain to employ the one you just purchased (see <i>Fig. 3</i>). Done! Now after a while (the changes are not shown immediately) your Github Pages
	  should be published on your own custom domain. </li>

	  of your own site, if you are someone who is very new or intermediate on website development, you can 
	  check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"></b>W3Schools</b></a> for helps, which provides excellent resources, examples, tutorials, and templates on 
	  <font face="courier">html</font>, <font face="courier">CSS</font>, <font face="courier">Javascript</font>, and many other website-related stuff. I personally
	  recommend <font face="courier">W3.CSS</font>, which is a moderm <font face="courier">CSS</font> library that makes website development more efficient. </p>
	  
	  <p>Hope you enjoy creating your own site!</p>
